# The other side of the MEOW transaction from meow-client.feature: here the
# SUT is the Medication Overview Responder (a server), and ITB drives the
# exchange as the Consumer. That reverses the hard part — ITB sends and the
# SUT answers, so nothing depends on <receive> or on ITB replying, and every
# assertion is on a response ITB fetched itself.

Feature: IHE MEOW Medication Overview Responder — server-side conformance
  Exercises the Responder actor of the IHE PHARM MEOW profile:

    tc-meow-server-001  PHARM-11 query by patient (the required baseline)
    tc-meow-server-002  PHARM-11 optional search parameters are honoured
    tc-meow-server-003  PHARM-11 rejects a query missing the required patient
    tc-meow-server-004  PHARM-12 Document Option — retrieve a MedicationOverview

  Scenario ids are kept one-transaction-per-scenario on purpose, so a
  TestPlan can later scope each to the PHARM-11 / PHARM-12 transaction it
  covers without having to split anything up.

  Responder capabilities per the CapabilityStatement in ihe.pharm.meow
  (https://profiles.ihe.net/PHARM/MEOW/CapabilityStatement/MedicationOverviewResponder,
  mode: server):
    MedicationStatement  search-type, read  — PHARM-11, profiled as
                         MedicationTreatmentLine. `patient` REQUIRED;
                         `status`, `effective`, `category`, `_lastUpdated`
                         optional.
    Bundle               search-type, read  — PHARM-12 Document Option,
                         profiled as MedicationOverview. `patient` required
                         for patient-scoped document search; `type`, `date`
                         optional.

  # ==================================================================
  # POINTED AT A PUBLIC FHIR SERVER — NOT A CONFORMANCE RUN
  # ==================================================================
  # The SUT is https://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4 with patient 137202631, picked
  # because it actually holds data: 10 MedicationStatements, all for that
  # subject, all status=active. That makes the test EXECUTE end to end,
  # which is what it is for right now.
  #
  # hapi is a plain FHIR server, NOT a MEOW Responder, so expect:
  #   001  passes except the meta.profile check — nothing there claims
  #        MedicationTreatmentLine
  #   002  passes: status=active filters, _lastUpdated=gt2999 is empty
  #   003  FAILS: hapi answers 200 to an unscoped query instead of 400
  #   004  FAILS: no MEOW document Bundles, and /Bundle/meow-test-overview
  #        does not exist
  #
  # Those failures are the test working correctly against a server that
  # does not implement the profile. Point the Background at a real
  # Responder for an actual conformance run.
  #
  # The patient id CANNOT be lifted into a variable: `gets from <Actor> at
  # "<path>"` compiles the path to a TDL string literal inside concat(),
  # and TDL string literals do not interpolate $variables (the same caveat
  # en.yml documents on the absolute `gets "<url>"` form). So it is a
  # find-and-replace on the id, or reach for `call scriptlet` with an
  # inline body if you need a genuinely dynamic path.

  Background:
    Given MedicationOverviewResponder is the system under test at "https://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4" as defined by "https://profiles.ihe.net/PHARM/MEOW/CapabilityStatement/MedicationOverviewResponder"
    # ITB plays the Consumer — it originates every request below.
    And MedicationOverviewConsumer is infrastructure as defined by "https://profiles.ihe.net/PHARM/MEOW/CapabilityStatement/MedicationOverviewConsumer"
    # GITB-compatible FHIR validator (validator_cli.jar). Same actor the
    # RACSEL track features and meow-client.feature use.
    And FHIRValidator is a fhir-validator at "http://fhir-validator:8080"

  # ==================================================================
  # 1. PHARM-11 — query by patient
  # ==================================================================
  Scenario: tc-meow-server-001 PHARM-11 query by patient returns treatment lines

    # IHE MEOW 1.0.0-preview, the official IHE publication — the only
    # version published (packages.fhir.org lists 1.0.0-preview and nothing
    # else). No local package server involved.
    #
    # The URL MUST end in .tgz. The validator sniffs format from the
    # extension, so the registry form
    # https://packages.fhir.org/ihe.pharm.meow/1.0.0-preview — which serves
    # the identical 187,692-byte tarball but carries no extension — makes it
    # read gzip bytes as XML and die with
    # "[Fatal Error] :1:1: Invalid byte 1 of 1-byte UTF-8 sequence".
    #
    # KNOWN: this build has broken Bundle.entry slicing — it mis-slices every
    # entry into the Patient slice, which is why RACSEL-track3 carries a
    # 10-clause exact-error mask. The `conforms to` in tc-meow-server-004 is
    # expected to report errors against it. Deliberately NOT masked here: the
    # errors are real output from the real published profile, and masking
    # them would hide genuine findings alongside the known ones. Remove this
    # note once 1.0.0-preview2 (fixed slicing) is published.
    When MedicationOverviewConsumer loads IG "https://profiles.ihe.net/PHARM/MEOW/package.tgz" on FHIRValidator

    # ------------------------------------------------------------------
    # The one mandatory PHARM-11 query: patient and nothing else.
    # ------------------------------------------------------------------
    When MedicationOverviewConsumer gets from MedicationOverviewResponder at "/MedicationStatement?patient=137202631" as $lines
    Then $response.status should be 200
    And $lines should not be empty

    # A FHIR search always answers with a searchset Bundle, never a bare
    # resource and never an OperationOutcome on success.
    And $lines at "Bundle.type" should be "searchset"

    # The server must actually hold data for the test patient — an empty
    # searchset is a valid Bundle but tells us nothing about conformance,
    # so fail loudly rather than pass vacuously.
    And $lines at "Bundle.entry.exists()" should be true

    # Every entry must be a MedicationStatement. `.all()` is empty-true in
    # FHIRPath, which is why the existence check above has to come first.
    And $lines at "Bundle.entry.resource.all($this is MedicationStatement)" should be true

    # Every returned line must be for the patient that was asked for —
    # catches a server that ignores the search parameter and returns
    # everything it has.
    And $lines at "Bundle.entry.resource.subject.reference.all(endsWith('137202631'))" should be true

    # PHARM-11 profiles the response as MedicationTreatmentLine. A server
    # that claims the profile must say so in meta.profile.
    And $lines at "Bundle.entry.resource.meta.profile.where($this.startsWith('https://profiles.ihe.net/PHARM/MEOW/StructureDefinition/MedicationTreatmentLine')).exists()" should be true

  # ==================================================================
  # 2. PHARM-11 — optional search parameters
  # ==================================================================
  # Each optional parameter is checked by its EFFECT, not merely by the
  # server returning 200: a server that accepts `status=active` and then
  # ignores it is not conformant, and a status-code check would miss that.
  Scenario: tc-meow-server-002 PHARM-11 honours the optional search parameters

    # ------------------------------------------------------------------
    # status — narrow to active treatment lines.
    # ------------------------------------------------------------------
    When MedicationOverviewConsumer gets from MedicationOverviewResponder at "/MedicationStatement?patient=137202631&status=active" as $activeLines
    Then $response.status should be 200
    And $activeLines at "Bundle.type" should be "searchset"
    # The filter must have been applied — no non-active line may come back.
    And $activeLines at "Bundle.entry.resource.all(status = 'active')" should be true

    # ------------------------------------------------------------------
    # category — the medication list category / list type.
    # ------------------------------------------------------------------
    When MedicationOverviewConsumer gets from MedicationOverviewResponder at "/MedicationStatement?patient=137202631&category=community" as $categoryLines
    Then $response.status should be 200
    And $categoryLines at "Bundle.type" should be "searchset"

    # ------------------------------------------------------------------
    # _lastUpdated — the incremental-sync parameter. A far-future instant
    # must return an EMPTY searchset: nothing can have been updated after
    # it. This proves the parameter is applied without depending on any
    # particular test data.
    # ------------------------------------------------------------------
    When MedicationOverviewConsumer gets from MedicationOverviewResponder at "/MedicationStatement?patient=137202631&_lastUpdated=gt2999-01-01" as $futureLines
    Then $response.status should be 200
    And $futureLines at "Bundle.type" should be "searchset"
    And $futureLines at "Bundle.entry.exists()" should be false

  # ==================================================================
  # 3. PHARM-11 — the required parameter is enforced
  # ==================================================================
  # `patient` is the one REQUIRED search parameter. A Responder that
  # answers 200 with everything it holds for a query with no patient is
  # leaking across patients, so this is a security-relevant check, not a
  # pedantic one.
  Scenario: tc-meow-server-003 PHARM-11 rejects a query without the required patient

    When MedicationOverviewConsumer gets from MedicationOverviewResponder at "/MedicationStatement" as $unscoped

    # Expect a client error. 400 is the usual answer; a server that uses
    # 422 instead is still refusing the query — change the expected code
    # here if that is your server's documented behaviour.
    Then $response.status should be 400

    # FHIR requires an OperationOutcome to carry the refusal, and it must
    # be error-or-worse, not a warning the client could ignore.
    And $unscoped at "OperationOutcome.issue.exists()" should be true
    And $unscoped at "OperationOutcome.issue.where(severity in ('error' | 'fatal')).exists()" should be true

  # ==================================================================
  # 4. PHARM-12 — Document Option
  # ==================================================================
  # Only applies to a Responder that declares the Document Option. Skip
  # this scenario for a Responder that supports PHARM-11 alone.
  Scenario: tc-meow-server-004 PHARM-12 returns a conformant MedicationOverview

    When MedicationOverviewConsumer loads IG "https://profiles.ihe.net/PHARM/MEOW/package.tgz" on FHIRValidator

    # ------------------------------------------------------------------
    # Patient-scoped document search. `patient` is required here too.
    # ------------------------------------------------------------------
    When MedicationOverviewConsumer gets from MedicationOverviewResponder at "/Bundle?patient=137202631&type=document" as $docSearch
    Then $response.status should be 200
    And $docSearch at "Bundle.type" should be "searchset"
    And $docSearch at "Bundle.entry.exists()" should be true

    # The search wraps the overview: outer Bundle is the searchset, the
    # entry resource is the MedicationOverview document itself.
    And $docSearch at "Bundle.entry.resource.all($this is Bundle)" should be true
    And $docSearch at "Bundle.entry.resource.all(type = 'document')" should be true

    # ------------------------------------------------------------------
    # Read the overview directly and hold the server to the profile.
    #
    # NOTE ON THE ID: like the patient id, this is a literal — the id
    # cannot be carried over from the search above, because a TDL string
    # literal will not interpolate a $variable into the path. Replace
    # `meow-test-overview` with a real Bundle id from your server.
    # ------------------------------------------------------------------
    When MedicationOverviewConsumer gets from MedicationOverviewResponder at "/Bundle/meow-test-overview" as $overview
    Then $response.status should be 200

    # Cheap structural gate before the expensive profile validation, so a
    # wrong payload fails clearly instead of as a wall of validator output.
    And $overview at "Bundle.type" should be "document"

    # The conformance assertion proper — fails on any error-level issue.
    And $overview should conform to "https://profiles.ihe.net/PHARM/MEOW/StructureDefinition/MedicationOverview"

    # Content checks the profile alone will not catch: a Bundle can be
    # structurally valid and still be an empty overview.
    And $overview at "Bundle.entry.resource.ofType(Composition).count()" should be 1
    And $overview at "Bundle.entry.resource.ofType(Patient).exists()" should be true
    And $overview at "Bundle.entry.resource.ofType(MedicationStatement).exists()" should be true
